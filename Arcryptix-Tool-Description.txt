VAPT Essentials – Tool Breakdown

Nmap – Network scanner used to find live hosts, open ports, and services running on servers. Essential for recon.
Ghidra – Reverse engineering framework by the NSA, used for analyzing binaries and malware during deeper exploit investigations.
Burp Suite – Industry-leading web application testing suite for intercepting and manipulating HTTP/S traffic.
Nikto – Web server scanner that checks for outdated software, common misconfigs, and known vulnerabilities.
Metasploit – Exploitation framework that tests for and simulates real-world attacks using known vulnerabilities.
Gobuster / dirb / ffuf / wfuzz – Directory and file brute-forcers to discover hidden paths on web servers.
OWASP Zap – Open-source alternative to Burp Suite; used for automated web vulnerability scans.
SQLmap – Automates SQL injection discovery and exploitation.
Amass / DNSenum – Subdomain and DNS enumeration tools used for asset discovery and domain mapping.


Regulatory Compliance Evaluation – Tools + Methods

EDR (Endpoint Detection & Response) – Solutions like CrowdStrike, SentinelOne, or Wazuh for endpoint threat detection.
Audit Logging – Tracks user activity, logins, file access, and admin changes.
Access Control Reviews – Reviews who has access to which systems and why.
Policy Templates – Includes Acceptable Use, Incident Response, MFA Enforcement, etc.
Framework Mapping – Mapping current posture to HIPAA, GDPR, NIST 800-53, PCI DSS, and more.


Real-Time Monitoring Setup – Tool Breakdown

ELK Stack – Collect logs (Logstash), index/store them (Elasticsearch), and visualize (Kibana).
Wazuh / Ossec – Lightweight agents for SIEM and FIM (file integrity monitoring).
Suricata / Zeek – Network traffic analyzers for detecting malicious activity.
Auditd + Filebeat – Linux tools to track command execution and file changes.
Sigma / YARA – Detection rule sets to identify malware and suspicious behaviors.
